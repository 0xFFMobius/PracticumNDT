    "# Capture and Processing of Non-Destructive Data Streams\n",
    "The output results of new non-destructive testing equipment needs to be analyzed over time to determine if process or equipment shifts occur. Process shifts will be detrimental to the company's ability to certify product, and may require additional rework. The project's focus will be on the development of the data-pipeline over the determination of process shifts. There are two major types of items that the inspection equipment will be reviewing. The first is production material. Detected flaws must be reacted to both upstream (fixing the cause) and downstream (responding to non-conforming product). The second type of item is a verification piece. The verification piece has known defects in the material which all need to be found, at approximately the same detection level every time the verification is run. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inspection equipment has controlling GUI. The GUI allows fro the review inspection results, but it is not an acceptable method to perform automatic reviews of the data. The GUI executable does expose a socket based API which allows for machine to machine data transfer. Some test result values are compiled by GUI, and can be retrieved. These results are not representative of all needed parameters which are important to the business operation e.g. (validating the inspection system is healthy). The raw stream data of the tests must also be extracted and processed for statistical characteristics. These characteristics will be tracked over time to look for process shifts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data streams and interface have similarities to big data. The communications, analysis, data storage and tracking all need to be developed. These steps will include drawing from multiple data sources (TCP socket API, SQL), and publication of transformed data an SQL database in real time. Basic visualizations for determining process shifts should be included. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Required Data To Be Processed\n",
    "A year ago, the NDT team determined what information will be necessary to capture on the verification rails either as a customer requirement or for process understanding. For the scope of this project, I will be focused on the calibration/verification data rather than product dat Below is a listing of those data.\n",

Although it did work, the needed networking configuration to communicate with the other source databases was complicated by IT network policies.\n",

    "After some additional research, I discovered MS SQL local database. After installing the SQL kernel, I was able to create a local only database which is suitable for small application development. The SQL database connection is exposed via a local host network pipe protocol. Once connected using the network pipe, the SQL server acts as if it was a full SQL server. This is an interesting alternative to a SQLite database for small applications. One of the more annoying aspects of using this method is that every instance of the database, once closed, changes its pipe path. \n",

    "I found an online database diagraming software, dbdiagram.io. They allow for using simple syntax to build database diagrams. Below is the code that formats 95% of the table structures. The remaining 5% is done by hand, dealing with some naming convention inaccuracies. Final script is at [data diagram](dbdiagram_all.txt). There are nearly 110 tables and 1100 columns in the database. Going through the whole diagram is difficult, but visualizing some of the relationships could be important. The most useful part of this exercise is understanding the vendor's table and index name scheme. Their foreign keys are FK_\\<abbreviation of current db\\>_<connectedDB\\>Index."
